# VirusApp

SIRS model of Albert Barabasi network. A group project on the Complex Systems course to simulate the spread of the virus in society. I was responsible for visualizing a neural network of sick, healed and neutral nodes in Python. I was involved in creating C# .Net window application that showed the virus incidence in society on graphs.

## How the plot_network.py script works?

* The plot_network script was written in Python language. It draws the neural netowrk diagrams from a text data file.
* The script uses three libraries (pandas, networkxx and matplotlib.pyplot).
* First the script reads the file ‘nodes.txt’, where is the number of nodes and its specific state written. 
Then it creates empty lists, where we can store the node id, node state, and the nodes of specific color. 
After that in a for loop we add the first column from file nodes.txt to node_id and second column form file nodes.txt to node_state list. 
After that we append the node_id of diffrent node_state to the blue, red and green_nodes
At second step we read the data about edges to edges variable from the text file ‘edges.txt’.
After that we generate new G graph using networkx.Graph() method.
Then we add edges to the graph using G.add_edges() method. As firt argument of the method we give the edges.txt first column as edges[0][i]. As second argument of the method we give the edges.txt second column as edges[1][i].
Then we create a dictionary, for labeling the nodes. 
We create new fig variable with plt.figure(figsize(x,y)) value. After that we draw the nodes, edges and the legend of our network.
At the end we show the plot and save it with big dpi in PDF and PNG file format.

Fig.1. Albert Barabasi network of SIRS model plotted using four different layouts (random, circular, spring, spectral). Parameter used in simulation: n = 500, m0 = 1, m = 1, prob. S-I = 0.9, prob. I-R = 0.5, prob. R-S - 0.5, percent of I = 1.

## How the Virus Spread App works ?

We've created a window application that helps us visualize the simulation of the SIRS model. The application was written in C #. It uses .exe program written in C ++. When opening the application, the following window appears to us:

In the left side panel we can choose the Barabassi network parameters and SIRS simulation parameters. Then we click "Initialize", and the application saves the data to „ini_parameters.txt” file.

After that the „Barabassi_Network.exe” ( a „.cpp” file ) is called from the VIRUS SPREAD App. Then The „Barabassi_Network.exe” gives an output. We get three text data files - „nodes.txt”, „edges.txt” and „virus_spread.txt”. In this case we need only the third file. Then the application reads the text file and puts i tinto the „dataVievGrid”. We get spread sheet with four columns (t, S, I, R), where t is the time, S is the number of health people, I the number of infected people and R is the number of removed /recovered people. At the end the data is plotted on the line chart.
The application gives us the opportunity to save the chart to the png format. 
We can see the spreadsheet with the „virus_spread.txt”. text data file, after clicking on the „Show Data” button.

The application gives us the opportunity to save the data to the text format.
